# Osseus Framework

#### Current version is alpha-2 (v0.1.0)

Osseus is a light and tiny PHP framework and toolbox. Its goal is to be flexible and impartial to code and database structures.

The plan for this is to also be able to interface with FluentPDO 2.0 and provide quick and seamless database interactions.

Osseus can be used as a standard application framework or simply as a utility library.

### Features

- light and fast router with a smart URI parser
- built-in security tools to validate and sanitize data
- an Internationalization template system to implement new languages quickly and easily
- classic MVC system with some small additions

### Contributions
Contributors are more than welcome to help test and improve Env

### Looking forward to 'alpha-3' (v0.2.0)
- Flesh out `Carbon` interface and class
