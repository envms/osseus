# Osseus Framework - alpha-1

Osseus is a light and tiny PHP API framework and toolbox. Its goal is to be flexible
and impartial to code and database structures. Currently, it contains a built-in, basic
JSON parser class, but the `Parse` interface can be extended to support XML, YAML etc.

The plan for this is to also be able to interface heavily with FluentPDO 2.0
(development in progress) and provide quick and seamless database interactions.

It can be used as a standard application framework, but was not designed for
this purpose.

### Contributions
Contributors are more than welcome to help test and improve Env

### Looking forward to 'alpha-2'
- Create core unit tests
- Flesh out `Carbon` interface and class
